   <p>Hai, Arleta Marissa Adhitya Soebagyo!</p>
   <p>How are youu? hope you feel well as always, so what do you think? HAHAHA pretty cool right? seorang Deric belajar coding :D, currently i'm writing this before knowing kamu bisa ikut perpisahan osis tanggal 14 nanti or not, semoga sih kamu ikutt biar aku ga titip my gift for you to someone else :> (which is probably Azmi HAHAHAHA)</p>
   <p>Anyways, i know i said it's our last meeting like multiple times tapi nanti juga bakal ketemu lagi ternyata HAHAHAHA but the one thing i haven't said is..</p>
   <p>Thank you, Let. For everything.</p>
   <p>For all our moments & memories that i will forever remember during my time in jhs. It was such a fun 3 years for me, and a very memorable last year too. I wanna thank you for always being there and having me as your trusted person :D, i'm very grateful i have someone like you to talk to, to annoy, to tell my stories, to vent, and so much more that i can't put here too.</p>
   <p>9 months isn't a short time, chatting with you made me learn a lot to become a better individual overall, i hope we both improve on our talents and become great people. Honestly i don't have that much to say, but i do hope the both of us get to go to our dream high schools (which is SMAN 2 ofc) and able to see each other again!, yeay.</p>
   <p>Also, i wanna say sorry if i ever annoyed you or made you feel upset, i also wanna say sorry for leaving you a couple of times, that was not right of me to do, and i promise in the future i won't do that again.</p>
   <p>Lastly, my message to you is Please keep relying on me, keep spamming me, keep venting to me, keep telling all your little stories to me, and also please open up whenever you have something in your mind that bothers you, i'll gladly be the shoulder for you to rest upon yaa.</p>
   <p>Alright that might just be it, HOPEFULLY WE CAN KEEP US UP FOREVER YAAA !!! , btw coding is really fun you should try HAHAHAHA, byeeee !!</p>
